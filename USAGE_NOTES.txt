Usage notes & tips

- Data quality: Ensure your issues CSV has columns: title, body, labels.
- Label normalisation: The pipeline maps many label names to canonical classes; edit normalize_label in src/issue_pipeline.py to match your project's labels.
- For very small datasets, prefer manual rule-based triage or augment with external issue datasets.
- To integrate as a GitHub Action: create an action that runs prediction on new issues and posts a comment with suggested labels (always require human approval).
- Selenium scripts are optional and potentially brittle due to UI changes; use GitHub API for robust automation.
